  I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Microbiome Manipulation Lab at UTSC](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/microbiomemanipulationlab/).

 **I'm passionate about understanding microbial evolution and niche adaptation - both in the field and under controlled or experimental settings.**

 My current research seeks to examine tradeoffs between the production, storage, and in-soil application of candidate probiotics for agriculture. 
 
 My doctoral research used the kiwifruit pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae* to understand how plant pathogens evolve during incursions. Using this pathosystem, we examined effector requirements, redundancies, and repertoire refinement across different kiwifruit hosts, using complementary approaches of <mark>orchard-based genome biosurveillance</mark> and <mark>effector knockout strain competition!</mark>
