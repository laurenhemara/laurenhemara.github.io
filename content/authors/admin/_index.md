I'm a doctoral candidate in the [University of Auckland's Joint Graduate School in Plant and Food Science](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/our-research/jgs-plant-and-food-science.html/), based at [Plant & Food Research](https://plantandfood.co.nz/).

 I am passionate about understanding how plant pathogens emerge, evolve, and cause disease. In particular, I am interested in understanding how plant pathogens co-evolve with their hosts, both in the field and in experimental settings. 
 
 My PhD research focuses on using the kiwifruit pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae* to understand how plant pathogens evolve during incursions. I'm examining effector requirements, redundancies, and repertoire refinement across different kiwifruit hosts, using complementary approaches of ðŸŒ¿ **orchard-based genome biosurveillance**  and ðŸ§ª **effector knockout strain competition!**  

 I also dabble in photography - you can see some of my more recent pictures in my [gallery](#gallery)!
