abstract: Testing effector knockout strains of the *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. actinidiae
  biovar 3 (Psa3) for reduced in planta growth in their native kiwifruit host revealed
  a number of nonredundant effectors that contribute to Psa3 virulence. Conversely,
  complementation in the weak kiwifruit pathogen *P. syringae* pv. actinidifoliorum
  (Pfm) for increased growth identified redundant Psa3 effectors. Psa3 effectors hopAZ1a
  and HopS2b and the entire exchangeable effector locus (Î”EEL; 10 effectors) were
  significant contributors to bacterial colonisation of the host and were additive
  in their effects on virulence. Four of the EEL effectors (HopD1a, AvrB2b, HopAW1a
  and HopD2a) redundantly contribute to virulence through suppression of pattern-triggered
  immunity (PTI). Important Psa3 effectors include several redundantly required effectors
  early in the infection process (HopZ5a, HopH1a, AvrPto1b, AvrRpm1a and HopF1e).
  These largely target the plant immunity hub, RIN4. This comprehensive effector profiling
  revealed that Psa3 carries robust effector redundancy for a large portion of its
  effectors, covering a few functions critical to disease.

  alt_text: 'Why is Psa more virulent than Pfm? Timeline. 1) Which Psa genes are
    required for virulence? Which Psa effector knockout strains aren't able to
    infect kiwifruit plants as well as wild-type? 2) Does Pfm carry any genes
    that trigger host immunity? Can any of Pfm's effectors reduce Psa's ability
    to successfully infect kiwifruit plants? 3) Is host immunity the only reason
    Pfm is a weak pathogen? Will knocking out Pfm genes that trigger host
    immunity make it pathogenic? 4) Can we make Pfm more virulent by giving it
    Psa effectors? Can any of Psa's effectors increase Pfm's ability to
    successfully infect kiwifruit plants?'
